          The Acura NSX saw the arrival of a larger 3.2 L V6 engine for model
          year 1998, cars that are known as the NA2 Models (note that some NA1
          Models would continue to be sold into 1998). NA2 models are powered by
          an automatic or 6-speed manual transmission (as opposed to the
          previous 5-speed). The body style from this range would continue with
          pop-up headlights and a targa roof top, except for a coupé limited
          production NSX Zanardi Edition, special order cars, and European
          models which continued to be available in coupé and targa versions.
          The NSX would receive a Facelift for model year 2002, largely
          recognizable by the front fixed headlights, hence the name
          'pre-facelift' for vehicles in the 1998 to 2001 year range.
